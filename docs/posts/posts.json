Within the report we formulate models to predict 02 saturation and then use AIC and 10-fold cross validation to determine the best model for the existing data. All data comes from the California Current system, a hydrographic time-series data set ongoing since 1949.\nData citation: CalCOFI data are available for use without restriction.

Comparing AIC scores for model 1 (AIC = 619) and model 2 (AIC = 616), we find that model 2 has an overall lower AIC score indicating that it provides a better balance of explanatory power and simplicity compared to model 1. Both models have similar r-squared values around 0.95, thus given AIC scores model 2 appears to be the best fit.\nModel Selection pt.2 10-fold cross-validation\nBelow we use an alternative methodology to determine model selection, utilizing a 10-fold cross-validation method.\n\nhide\nset.seed(123)\n\ntr_ctrl <- trainControl(method = 'cv', number = 10) # cv tells cross-validation, number = # of folds\ntr_ctrl_repeated<- trainControl(method = 'repeatedcv', \n                                number = 10, repeats =10) # now this tells it to do repeated tests \n\n## train the model, the below function tells us using formula f1 and the specified data, build a lm \n ## now running with repeated for model1\n model1<- train(f1, data = seawater,\n                method = 'lm',\n                trControl = tr_ctrl_repeated)\n # RMSE      Rsquared   MAE     \n #  4.891453  0.9591882  3.503781\n\n  ## now running with repeated for model2\n model2<- train(f2, data = seawater,\n                method = 'lm', \n                trControl = tr_ctrl_repeated)\n # RMSE      Rsquared   MAE     \n #  4.808869  0.9614641  3.492599\n\n ## Making a table of results\n Model <- c(\"Model 1\", \"Model 2\")\n RMSE <- c(4.891453, 4.808869)\n R_Squared <- c(0.9591882, 0.9614641)\n MAE <- c(3.503781, 3.492599)\n k_fold_data <- data_frame(Model, RMSE, R_Squared)\n \n k_fold_data %>% \n   kbl(caption = \"Model Ranking based on 10-Fold Cross Validation\") %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Cambria\")\n\n\n\nTable 2: Model Ranking based on 10-Fold Cross Validation\n\n\nModel\n\n\nRMSE\n\n\nR_Squared\n\n\nModel 1\n\n\n4.891453\n\n\n0.9591882\n\n\nModel 2\n\n\n4.808869\n\n\n0.9614641\n\n\n10-fold Cross-Validation Summary Results: Based on results of our 10-fold cross-validation tests, we find that model 2 appears to be best fit; reconfirming previous findings from the AIC. Comparing RMSE’s for model 1 and 2 (see table 2) we find that while both models have similar R-squared values, model 2 has a lower relative RMSE, indicating it is better fit to our data.\nFinal Parametized Model predicting Oxygen Saturation\n\nhide\nfinal_mdl <- lm(f2, data = seawater)\n\n\n\nConclusion: Taking into account results of both the AIC and 10-fold cross validation, we determine that model 2 is the best fit model for the data. Model 2 had the relatively lowest AIC score as well as RMSE, indicating that it is superior in it’s simplicity, explanatory power, and data fit in comparison to model 1.\nOur final model: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{o2sat} &= \\alpha + \\beta_{1}(\\operatorname{t\\_deg\\_c}) + \\beta_{2}(\\operatorname{salinity}) + \\beta_{3}(\\operatorname{po4u\\_m})\\ + \\\\\n&\\quad \\beta_{4}(\\operatorname{depth\\_m}) + \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAnd with numbers: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{\\widehat{o2sat}} &= 144.07 - 0.75(\\operatorname{t\\_deg\\_c}) - 0.44(\\operatorname{salinity}) - 37.71(\\operatorname{po4u\\_m})\\ - \\\\\n&\\quad 0.03(\\operatorname{depth\\_m})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n",
