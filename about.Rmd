  I am a human behavioral ecologist, broadly interested in the evolutionary roots of contemporary gender issues and how evolutionary approaches to human behavior may help us to distinguish fundamental causes and pathways to change. In collaboration with our colleagues at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mwanza, Tanzania, our lab has conducted both qualitative and quantitative research exploring: effects of urbanization and shifts in women's socioeconomic status on couple's experience and approval of intimate partner violence; variation in men's support for women's empowerment; the role of indirect measurement techniques in improving field data collection on sensitive topics; and the costs for men who violate traditional gender norms.
